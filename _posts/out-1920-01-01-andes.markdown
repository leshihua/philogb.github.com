The Andes project creates topographic maps of Tweets for a number of
cities. It's a remix of the [Billion Strokes visualization](https://blog.twitter.com/2013/geography-tweets-3) by
[@miguelrios](https://twitter.com/miguelrios). The input data *are* the
images featured in that visualization.

[You can access the project here](http://twitter.github.io/interactive/andes/). Plase make sure to have a WebGL capable
machine and browser.

The San Francisco elevation map shows interesting elevations "under
water" in what's the BART path from SF to Oakland. In New York we can
see elevations for the ferry:

I personally like this contour map of Istanbul:
