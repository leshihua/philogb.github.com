![3D color Histogram Analysis](/assets/histogram/1.png)

Color decomposition on [RGB](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model#Geometric_representation)
or [other color schemes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV) takes a
3D form. In order to show the color decomposition of an image each dot on a
3D color histogram is assigned a different diameter. The following example renders fine grain
and precise color decomposition schemes of each frame of a video in real time. Notice how
color varies on each take, and feel free to change the color scheme or pause the
video to have a closer look at the color decomposition. You can interact with the visualization
by using drag and drop and zooming in/out with your mouse wheel.

browser (and machine).**
