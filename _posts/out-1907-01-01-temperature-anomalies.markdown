NASA collects year by year data about temperature changes around the globe.
This information has been collected since 1880 and tracks temperature anomalies (changes)
in different points of the earth as a 2D heatmap. By loading these images into textures
and then mapping them into a 3D histogram we are able to track the temperature changes around the globe interactively.
Smooth animations between date ranges enable us to spot the overall differences in temperature across the years.
Can you guess what the temperature changes will be for the next decade?
